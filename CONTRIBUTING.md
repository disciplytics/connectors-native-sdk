# Contributing to connectors-native-sdk

Dear developers, thank you for taking the time to improve the Native SDK for Connectors! As of now, we do not support 
the process of an external, direct contribution to the repository. However, we would be very pleased if you would like 
to share your thoughts, suggestions and diagnosed problems via [GitHub issues][issues].
