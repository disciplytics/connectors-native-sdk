# Snowflake Native SDK for Connectors GitHub Example

This example shows how to implement a simple connector application based on the [template](../../templates). This connector
uses GitHub API to retrieve the data about issues from a repository. This example includes all the basic steps of the Native SDK for Connectors flow.

Consult the step by step [quickstart](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/connectors_native_sdk_java_example) to learn more about the GitHub example connector.

You can find the [template here](../../templates) and the implementation tutorial in the [documentation](todo link to tutorial)

## Developer flow

This example is ready to be deployed after minimal configurations from the user. The suggested flow is:

1. Clone the example
2. Build and deploy ([Connector lifecycle](CONNECTOR_LIFECYCLE.md) for more information)
3. Configure in Snowflake
4. Ingest the data!
